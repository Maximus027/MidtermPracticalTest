Emulator used: Nexus 6, API 23.

Got stuck on the second step, could not figure out how to get pass the null reference. I know it's for records and I can see there are records with null values but I couldn't figure out how to only refer to the first once which houses the ten objects. I tried speaking to a TA but was not able to come to a solution for this.

Managed to finish the second step with 2 minutes to spare.
